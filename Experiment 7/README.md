**OBJECT:** Write an Echo_Client and Echo_server using TCP to
estimate the round trip time from client to the server.
**Round trip time(RTT)** is the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the
length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to be received. This
time therefore consists of the propagation times between the
two point of signal. On the Internet, an end user can determine the
RTT to and from an IP(Internet Protocol) address by pinging that address.
