**OBJECT:** Write two programs in java: 
1. hello_client 
2. hello_server
* The server listens for, and accepts, a single TCP connection; it reads all the data it
can from that connection, and prints it to the screen; then it closes the connection."
* The client connects to the server, sends the string “Hello, Server”, then closes the connection.
